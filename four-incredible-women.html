                 	<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our society needs to give up on the generalization that women can not rise to men. Women are similarly equipped at achieving fitness goals through sheer determination and the belief of not giving up. You'll be astounded to see the abilities and strengths of these female fitness influencers who have achieved great heights in their respective industries. <br /> <br /> However, we must acknowledge that everything they have achieved is because of years of hard work and training. Nothing comes easy and we have to applaud the way these women are changing the game in the fitness industry and motivating millions to lead a healthy life. Women are still stereotyped in India based on their look and build. They are looked down upon for having a muscular build and the society still believes that the only kind of workout made for women is Yoga, while men are usually associated with weight training.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These women are changing the way people look at the fitness industry with a gender-biased mindset. Be it weight training, pilates, yoga or healthy living, read this blog to get inspired by these incredible women.</span></p>

					<img src="assets/img/blog/1.2.jpg" width="200px">
					<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p3"><span class="s3">She is no less than a child prodigy. The youngest</span><span class="s4"> trained Stott Pilates instructor in the world, Namrata Purohit achieved this at a tender age of 16. She co-founded &lsquo;The Pilate Studio&rsquo; with her father Mr. Samir Purohit. Her achievements also include being the former official fitness partner to Femina Miss India Organization (since 2011) and the official Fitness Partner to Miss Diva (2013 and 2014). Namrata believes that fitness is a lot more than simply how one looks. Fitness is not only physical but also mental. It involves being strong, flexible, having good balance, stability, agility, mobility, coordination as well as endurance. It also involves feeling and being healthy, happy and having a good amount of energy.</span></p>

					<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lsquo;Let nothing stop you from fitness&rsquo;. No other words can define Yasmin better than these. The first ever Pilates instructor in India and one of the most sought after Celebrity fitness trainers, she has been in the bollywood fitness industry for more than 28 years. She has trained the likes of </span><span class="s5">Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone, Alia Bhatt, Bipasha Basu, Sophie Choudry, Huma Qureshi,Janhvi Kapoor, Evelyn Sharma,</span><span class="s1"> She specialises in weight training and Pilates and owns a fitness centre, named &lsquo;Yasmin's Body Image&rsquo; at 133 Hill Road, Bandra, West Mumbai.

					<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><strong>Sucheta Pal</strong></span></p>
					<img src="assets/img/blog/1.4.jpg" width="200px">
					<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes Zumba different from other forms of fitness? Well it&rsquo;s the fact that Zumba breaks the monotony. It changes the regular belief that workout is restricted to focus and strength and can&rsquo;t be enjoyed. Sucheta Pal has shown how that is possible by being named the brand ambassador for Zumba in 2016. She is one of the selected master trainers for Zumba in the world. How cool is that? Today, Pal has trained 3000 trainers, has countless classes and followers, and features in five television programmes, and doing all of it effortlessly while being a mother. She did not stop training and dancing even during pregnancy and has been an exceptional role model to mothers from all around the country.</span></p>

					<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><strong>Urmi Kothari</strong></span></p>
					<img src="assets/img/blog/1.5.jpg" width="200px">
					<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sports in India has a massive gender bias. So when Nike came out with its &lsquo;Dada Ding&rsquo; campaign, we hardly got the name of any of those athletes and trainers right. Well one of them was none other than the founder of Kinetic living, Urmi Kothari. She won a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>gold in the first ever National Kettlebell Championships organized by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.energy24x7.com/CommonPages/Home.htm">EKFA</a> and was also awarded as the best kettlebell lifter at Body Power Expo in March 2015. Kinetic Living aims at workouts integrated with calisthenics, Pilates, sports and yoga aimed at getting fit from within. </span></p>
					<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are certainly inspired by these lovely women and the likes of them in the fitness industry and wish to carry the spirit of staying fit and healthy forward with even more zeal and energy. Come join us in this journey with your family and let&rsquo;s make India fit again!</span></p>
